       <h1>Are you looking to explore the natural beauty of South India..?</h1>
       <p>1. If you are a nature lover who loves to explore the natural beauty of a country, you may be wondering where the best places are to visit in South India,Travelling South India was one of my favourite trips I took during my 2 years of living in India. With so many amazing destinations to choose from, it can be quite confusing knowing which places to put at the top of your list</p>
       <p>2. It is known for its rich biodiversity and the stunning mountain range of the Western Ghats. You can find everything from relaxing boat rides along the Kerala backwaters to lush green rolling hills, spectacular mountain formations, romantic nature getaways and adventurous treks.</p>
       <p>3. <strong>A side note:</strong> There are many national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in South India, especially in Kerala. I urge you to do extensive research on the parks before visiting them for the wildlife experiences. Many of these sanctuaries claim to be ethical. But they offer elephant rides and close encounters that stress the animals out. Some places have even been reported to chain elephants to trees to ensure tourists see them. These parks should not be supported. And such behaviour should always be reported to authorities. I will only list wildlife parks or sanctuaries that I know for sure are 100% ethical and honour the values of eco-tourism.</p>

                 <p><strong> Munnar</strong> is a town and hill station located in the <strong>Idukki</strong> district of the <strong>southwestern Indian</strong> state of Kerala. Munnar is situated at around <strong>1,600 metres</strong> (5,200 ft) above mean sea level, in the Western Ghats mountain range. Munnar is also called the <strong>"Kashmir of South India"</strong> and is a popular honeymoon destination.</p>

                 <p>The region has been inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribals like the <strong>Malayarayan</strong> and <strong>Muthuvan</strong> for thousands of years. In the early days, only <strong>Tamils</strong> and few <strong>Malayalis</strong> lived there. They were brought as workers in the tea plantations. Tradition states that Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington, was the first British person to pass through Munnar during Tipu Sultan's campaign in Travancore, but this is unsubstantiated. The first survey of the terrain was undertaken by Benjamin Swayne Ward in 1816–1817, who followed Periyar into the Western Ghats and established a camp at the confluence of three rivers, from which the name of Munnar is derived.</p>

                 <p>The region in and around Munnar varies in height from 1,450 meters (4,760 ft) to 2,695 meters (8,842 ft) above <strong>mean sea level</strong>. The temperature ranges between 5 °C (41 °F) and 25 °C (77 °F) in winter and 15 °C (59 °F) and 25 °C (77 °F) in summer.[11] Temperatures as low as −4 °C (25 °F) have been recorded in the Sevenmallay region of Munnar,There has been action to address the problems of property takeovers by the land mafia that have, according to successive governments, plagued the area. In 2011, the government estimated that 20,000 hectares of land had been illegally appropriated and launched a campaign of evictions that had first been mooted in 2007</p>

                 <h4>With so much beauty to explore here, these are my top recommendations of what to do in Munnar:</h4>

                     <p> <strong>Palani Hills</strong> are a mountain range in the southern Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The Palani Hills are an eastward extension of the <strong>Western Ghats ranges</strong>, which run parallel to the west coast of India. The Palani Hills adjoin with the high <strong>Anamalai</strong> range on the west and extend east into the plains of <strong>Tamil Nadu</strong>, covering an area of 2,068 square kilometres (798 sq mi). The highest part of the range is in the southwest, and reaches 1,800-2,500 metres (5,906-8,202 feet) elevation; the eastern extension of the range is made up of hills 1,000-1,500 m (3,281-4,921 ft) high.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Palani Hills</strong> have a montane tropical monsoon climate which varies from west to east. <strong>Generally</strong>, as one proceeds from the Kerala border in the west to the foothills in the east, average rainfall decreases and temperature increases. Compared to the Deccan plateau and the southwestern coastal plains, temperatures vary from moderate to quite cool. In the central Palani Hills at <strong>Kodaikanal</strong>, during <strong>March to May</strong>, the temperature range is between <strong>10.1 and 20.9 °C</strong>. The temperature can rise to a high of <strong>35 °C (95 °F)</strong>. During <strong>December to February</strong> it is between <strong> 8.1 and 18.6 °C (46.6 and 65.5 °F)</strong>. In <strong>January</strong>, night temperatures sometimes drop below freezing, and thin ice is seen on lake edges in the early morning</p>

                    <p>The sanctuary has been under consideration of the <strong> Government of India</strong> in consultation with the Government of <strong>Tamil Nadu</strong> since 1999.The actual park boundaries have not been finalized. In 2007, proposals for declaration of Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary were under consideration of the Governmen</p>

             <div className="pre">
              <p>The <strong>Kerala backwaters</strong> are a network of <strong>brackish lagoons</strong> and canals lying parallel to the <strong>Arabian Sea</strong> of the <strong>Malabar coast</strong> of Kerala state in south-western India. It also includes interconnected lakes, rivers, and inlets, a labyrinthine system formed by more than 900 km (560 mi) of waterways, and sometimes compared to <strong>bayous</strong>. The network includes five large lakes linked by canals, both man made and natural, fed by 38 rivers, and extending virtually half the length of Kerala state. The backwaters were formed by the action of waves and shore currents creating low <strong> barrier islands</strong> across the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the <strong>Western Ghats</strong> range. In the midst of this landscape there are a number of towns and cities, which serve as the starting and end points of backwater cruises. There are 34 backwaters in Kerala.[5] Out of it, 27 are located either closer to Arabian Sea or parallel to the sea.The remaining 7 are inland navigation routes</p>

              <p>The backwaters have a unique ecosystem: freshwater from the rivers meets the seawater from the Arabian Sea. A <strong>barrage</strong> has been built near <strong>Thanneermukkom</strong>, so salt water from the sea is prevented from entering the deep inside, keeping the fresh water intact. Such fresh water is extensively used for <strong>irrigation</strong> purposes. Many unique species of aquatic life including <strong>crabs</strong>, <strong>frogs</strong> and <strong>mudskippers</strong>, water birds such as , darters and cormstro
              terns, kingfishers orants, and animals such as otters and turtles live in and alongside the backwaters. Palm trees, pandanus shrubs, various leafy plants, and bushes grow alongside the backwaters, providing a green hue to the surrounding landscape.</p>

                

              

                 <h4>There are a number of appealing backwaters destinations, some of the most unique ones to explore are:</h4>
                 <pre><strong>Alleppey Backwaters</strong> – houseboat cruises with a natural and cultural experience</pre>
