       <h1>The Earliest Hindu Temples..</h1>
       <p>1. The earliest temple structures were not made of stones or bricks, which came much later. In ancient times, public or community temples were possibly made of clay with thatched roofs made of straw or leaves. Cave-temples were prevalent in remote places and mountainous terrains.</p>
       <p>2. Historians say <strong>Hindu temples</strong> did not exist during the Vedic period (1500-500 BCE). According to historian Nirad C. Chaudhuri, the earliest structures that indicate idol worship date back to the <strong> 4th or 5th century CE</strong>. There was a seminal development in temple architecture between the 6th and the 16th century CE. This growth phase of Hindu temples charts its rise and fall alongside the fate of the various dynasties that reigned in India during the period—majorly contributing and influencing the building of temples, especially in South India.</p>
       <p>3. <a href="https://www.learnreligions.com/who-is-a-hindu-1770060">Hindus</a> consider the building of temples an extremely pious act, bringing great religious merit. Hence, kings and wealthy men were eager to sponsor the construction of temples, notes Swami Harshananda, and the various steps of building the shrines were performed as <a href="https://www.learnreligions.com/hindu-wedding-rituals-1770478">religious rites</a>.</p>

                     <p><strong>Arulmigu Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple</strong>, also known as <strong>Arulmigu Meenakshi Amman Thirukkovil</strong>, is a historic <strong>Hindu temple</strong> located on the southern bank of the <strong>Vaigai River</strong> in the temple city of <strong>Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India</strong>. It is dedicated to the goddess Meenakshi Amman Nayak, a form of Parvati, and her consort, Sundareshwarar, a form of <strong>Shiva</strong>. The temple is at the centre of the ancient temple city of Madurai mentioned in the Tamil Sangam literature, with the goddess temple mentioned in 6th-century CE texts. This temple is one of the <strong>Paadal Petra Sthalams</strong>, which are 275 temples of Shiva that are revered in the verses of Tamil Saiva Nayanars of the 6th-9th century CE.</p>

                    <p>Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple was built by <strong>Pandyan</strong> Emperor <strong>Sadayavarman Kulasekaran</strong> I (1190 CE–1205 CE). He built the main portions of the three-storeyed Gopuram at the entrance of Sundareswarar Shrine and the central portion of the Goddess Meenakshi Shrine are some of the earliest surviving parts of the temple. The traditional texts call him a poet-saint king, additionally credit him with a poem called Ambikai Malai, as well as shrines (koil) each for Natarajar and Surya near the main temple, Ayyanar in the east, Vinayagar in the south, Kariamalperumal in the west and Kali in the north. He also built a Mahamandapam. Kulasekara Pandya was also a poet and he composed a poem on Meenakshi named Ambikai Malai. Maravarman Sundara Pandyan I built a <strong>gopuram</strong> in 1231, then called Avanivendaraman, later rebuilt, expanded and named as Sundara Pandya Thirukkopuram. Chitra gopuram (W), also known as Muttalakkum Vayil, was built by Maravarman Sundara Pandyan II (1238-1251). This gopuram is named after the frescoes and reliefs that depict secular and religious themes of Hindu culture. Maravarman Sundara Pandyan II also added a pillared corridor to the Sundareswara shrine and the Sundara Pandyan Mandapam.[9] It was rebuilt after the 14th-century damage, its granite structure was renovated by Kumara Krishnappar after 1595.[10]</p>

                     <p>Thestro <strong> Kailasanathar Temple</strong>, <strong>Kanchipuram</strong>, also referred to as the <strong>Kailasanatha temple</strong>, is a Pallava-era historic <strong>Hindu temple</strong> in Kanchipuram, <a href="">Tamil Nadu, India</a>. Dedicated to Shiva, it is one of the oldest surviving monuments in Kanchipuram. It reflects a Dravidian architecture and was built about 700 CE by Narasimhavarman II with additions by <strong>Mahendravarman</strong> III. A square-plan temple, it has a mukha-mandapa (entrance hall), a maha-mandapa (gathering hall) and a primary garbha-griya (sanctum) topped with a four-storey vimana. The main sanctum is surrounded by nine shrines, seven outside and two inside flanking the entrance of the sanctum, all with forms of Shiva. The outer walls of the temple's prakara (courtyard) is also surrounded by cells</p>

                    <p>The Kailasanathar temple is notable for its intricately carved galaxy of Hindu art in the late 7th- and early 8th-century Tamil tradition. These largely relate to <strong>Shaivism</strong>, yet also include significant number of themes from <strong>Vaishnavism, Shaktism</strong> and Vedic deities. The temple is also notable for one of the early and best specimens of <strong>Hindu mural art</strong> in Tamil Nadu. This is found in the inner walls of the courtyard cells. The murals are in a style that is also found in the Ajanta Caves, as well as in the historic paintings in the 8th-century Vaikunthaperumal temple, also in Kanchipuram. The temple walls have many inscriptions in early scripts, important to the epigraphical study of regional history and Tamil temple traditions</p>
                    <p>The structure contains 58 small shrines which are dedicated to various forms of Shiva. These are built into niches on the inner face of the high compound wall of the <strong>circumambulatory passage</strong>. The temple is one of the most prominent tourist attractions of the city.</p>

                     <p>The <strong>Mahabaleshwar Temple</strong>, <strong>Gokarna</strong> is a 4th-century CE <strong>Hindu temple</strong> located in <strong> Gokarna</strong>, <strong>Uttara Kannada</strong> district, <strong>Karnataka</strong> state, <strong>India</strong> which is built in the classical <strong>Dravidian architectural</strong> style. It is a site of <strong>religious pilgrimage</strong>. The temple faces the Gokarna beach on the Arabian Sea. The temple deifies the Pranalinga ("the reality of God which can be captured by the mind") also called Atmalinga or Shiva Linga In legend, it is said that the deity of the temple will bestow immense blessings to devotees, even to those who only glimpse it. Currently the administrative charge of the temple is with an Overseeing Committee under the Chairmanship of Justice BN Srikrishna, a Retired Justice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. It is one of the 275 <strong>paadal petra sthalams</strong> expounded in the Tevaram, a sacred Tamil Shaivite text written during the 6th and 7th centuries by 63 saints called Nayanars.</p>

                    <p>The temple's first construction was by the king <strong>Mayurasharma</strong> of the <strong> Kadamba dynasty</strong> (reign 345–365 CE). Again, legend holds that Mayurasharma wished to learn of the Vedic rites and the <strong>Ashwamedha Yagna</strong> (ritual of horse sacrifice). He travelled to Kanchipuram, a major religious learning centre, but there, he was insulted by a horseman guard. He was angered and swore to defeat the ruling Pallava dynasty. Following his defeat of the Pallavas, the king asked some priests to perform a daily yajna to maintain his suzerainty over the region. Mayurasharma's son, King <strong>Kangavarma</strong> brought <strong>Brahmin</strong> families from different lineages to maintain administration at the temple.</p>
