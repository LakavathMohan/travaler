                     <p> This temple had its origins in Kushasthali <strong>Cortalim</strong>, a village in <strong>MormugÃ£o</strong> which fell to the invading Portuguese in 1543. In the year 1560, when the Portuguese started <strong>Christian conversions</strong> in <strong>mormugao</strong> taluka, the Saraswats of Kaundinya Gotra and Vatsa Gotra moved the Mangesh Linga from the original site at the Kushasthali or Cortalim on the banks of river Aghanashini (Zuari)(Sancoale) to its present location at Mangeshi in Priol village of Atrunja Taluka, which was then ruled by the Hindu kings of Sonde of Antruz Mahal (Ponda), to be more secure.</p>
                    <p>Since the time of the shifting, the temple has been rebuilt and renovated twice during the reign of the Marathas and again in the year 1890. The final renovation occurred in the year 1973 when a golden <strong>kalasha</strong> (holy vessel) was fitted atop the tallest dome of the temple</p>

                    <p>Goa's unique culture and heritage are on full display at Mangeshi Temple, a beautiful spiritual attraction that's been standing for roughly 450 years. The pastel blue,gold, and white temple features a <strong>seven-story tower</strong> that pays homage to one of the Hindu god Shiva's many incarnations: Manguesh. The temple structures surround a <strong>sacred pool of water</strong>, which is thought to be the most historic part of this religious site.</p>
